- Start point: Remember basic html structure

  <DOCTYPE! <!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8" />
  <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
  <title>Page Title</title>
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="screen" href="main.css" />
  <script src="main.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
  
</body>
</html>

or more simply

<!DOCTYPE html>
<head>
  <!-- meta info goes here -->
</head>
<body>
  <!-- Content goes here -->
</body>

- Header: <header> a container that holds website's header

- Navigation: list of links
  1) use <ul> for nav bar
  2) Inside of <ul> use list item <li> tag for each link in our nav bar

- Nav bar li needs to be link
  <a> tag with attribute href, controls URL your browser opens when clicking the link on the page.
  <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a>
  - when we don't know the exact URL yet, we use # (hash) for place holder.  

- Phase 2: 
1) Add CSS reset ext CSS file
2) Style the nav links
3) Style the reset of the header

- 1) Add CSS reset ext CSS file
We already know <style> is one way to include CSS into HTML.  Next, CSS can be included via <link> tag which is external css file.

  * link tag must have 2 things:
    1) href - a URL where the CSS file lives
    2) rel - which should always be set to "stylesheet"
    ex) 
    <link href="http://dash.ga.co/normalize.css" rel="stylesheet">
    - good to always include normalize.css to all web project.

  - by default browser gives some padding to list bullets points which makes links off-center!  We may fix this by using padding property to set 10px of padding on all sides.  As a default, bullet points are part of 40 px padding only left for ul padding.  By giving 10px you move the bullet off the screen and center the ul element.
    ul {
      /* fixing the list nav links be centered */
      padding: 10px; 
    }

    <ul>
      <li><a href="#">About Me</a></li>
      <li><a href="#">Best Poems</a></li>
      <li><a href="#">Worst Poems</a></li>
    </ul>
- Make list to look horizontal
  li {
    display: inline;
  }
  display usu. two types: block or inline.
  * block: stretch whole width of the page
  * inline: <a> is by default display inline. element exist within the normal flow of the text they're contained within - no line breaks, no taking up the whole width of the page.

  * giving links some breathing room:
    li {
      display: inline;
      padding: 0px 10px 0 10px;
    }

- Header style
  header {
    text-align: center;
    background: url("http://dash.ga.co/assets/jeff-bg.png");
    background-size: cover;
  }

- if you want to style links color; you must explicitly set it to the color; unlike heading or paragraph tag; it won't inherit from its parent element.
  a {
    color: white;
  }

- padding (inside) vs margin (outside)

- border CSS to have white border with rounded edges! prop short hand for border-width, border-style, and border-color.
  border: 7px solid white;
  border-radius: 20px;

- Lesson 3:
  1) Give the content a responsive design
  2) Learn about advanced colors
  3) Make our own "like" button in Javascript

- 1) Give the content a responsive design
 * give your site response to different device width gracefully
 first focus on restructuring the site
 - Wrap <article> around each blog post, lets group together multiple HTML elements that forms a single piece of content.

  ex) 
  <article>
    <h2>Succulents freegan vegan letterpress brunch chambray</h2>
      <p>Typewriter synth sustainable enamel pin schlitz fashion axe. Disrupt put a bird on it etsy tofu whatever next level occupy photo booth subway tile synth VHS wayfarers man bun. Meditation echo park cardigan photo booth portland, fanny pack neutra authentic pickled. Lumbersexual actually before they sold out yuccie tousled, retro gluten-free wolf bicycle rights.</p>
